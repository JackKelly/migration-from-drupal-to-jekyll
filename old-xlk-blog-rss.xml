 <title>old blog: 30 hits an hour!</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/03/30_hits_an_hour.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;According to my web logs, my site is getting an average of 30 hits an hour!  Cool!  I know a lot of that traffic will be trawler robots (for search engines) but it&#039;s still cool!  If you&#039;re reading this, please do leave me a comment to say hi!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: That damn clicking</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/03/that_damn_click.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now my bike has taken to making a clicking noise every time I put pressure on the right pedal.  This is annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday evening I removed the broken plastic cover to the front cog - this did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I injected loads of grease into the right pedal.  This did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I dismantled the bottom bracket, cleaned it with WD40 and re-greased it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clicking seemed to have gone when I did a quick test ride but it came back and stayed for about 2/3 of my ride in this morning.  But by the end of the ride the clicking had gone.  Very odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#039;m going to give my bike a good cleaning this weekend, once I get myself a good chain cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: News Groups problems</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/03/news_groups_pro.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanna send a question to some bike newsgroups to ask what the best way to clean the chain is but I&#039;ve been having general problems with newsgroups recently.  Outlook express tells me it&#039;s sent the message (which I&#039;m sending to several groups at once) but the message never turns up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&#039;s because one of the groups I&#039;m sending to is moderated?  Not sure...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 10:50&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, it seems the problem occurs when I have a moderated group in the &quot;to&quot; field.  I&#039;ve now succesfully sent a couple of messages - one about bikes and one about latitude on the XL1-s&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and just for the record, we tried our first online shop last night.  Tescos should be knocking on our door this evening with a big truck load of food.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been chatting with a few people recently (Alex from COMPLEX &amp; Dan H) regarding my bike&#039;s pedals.  I think I&#039;m gonna look into buying SPDs.  Apparently I needn&#039;t worry about not coming out of the pedals in a crash.  And they make a lot of difference in efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: WiFi</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/04/wifi.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been thinking of building a WiFi network at home for a few months now.  I&#039;ve been holding off because I&#039;d like a system with 802.11i security (AES in hardware) and 802.11e QoS.  I was worried that none of the current hardware would be able to do AES in hardware but it turns out I&#039;m wrong.  Perhaps I should start to look at the chipsets for the Dlink, 3Com, Belkin and Ebuyer systems I&#039;ve looked at.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>old blog: Hacking phpBB to stop logging IP addresses</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/04/hacking_phpbb_t.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;John King figured this out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In phpBB2.0.8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;open common.php&lt;br /&gt;
change line 155 from &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$user_ip = encode_ip($client_ip);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$user_ip = encode_ip(&#039;10.0.0.10&#039;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or replace &quot;10.0.0.10&quot; to anything you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now posting should be entirely anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m worried the hacked BB won&#039;t allow you to vote anonymously (because it&#039;ll assume that you&#039;re always using 10.0.0.10).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I could setup Wikis on my website for King&#039;s and/or for the UCL Postgrads to write a &quot;how to survive your PhD&quot;.  I should look into these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kings site should really be tightly linked into the library of photos.  So, for example, people could write articles on the photos.  Articles which would be editable by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All 3Com.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simply.co.uk/productinformation/45228/WW/3COM_11G_ACCESS_POINT_AND_GET_A_FREE_11G_PC_CARD/index.htm&quot;&gt;Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3Com &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3com.com/prod/en_UK_EMEA/detail.jsp?tab=features&amp;sku=3CRWE154G72&quot;&gt;3CRWE154G72&lt;/a&gt; Cardbus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.conexant.com/products/entry.jsp?id=885&quot;&gt;Connexant Prism GT ISL3877&lt;/a&gt; chipset (same as D-Link&#039;s DWL-G650 I think).  Linux compatible.  802.11e, WPA.  AES in hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3com.com/prod/en_UK_EMEA/detail.jsp?tab=features&amp;sku=3CRWE454G72&quot;&gt;The 3CRWE454G72 WAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a little harder to track down.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Reviews-133-ProdID-3CRWE554G72.php&quot;&gt;Tom&#039;s Networking&lt;/a&gt; tells me that 3Com use Accton to make their stuff.  Accton have an 11g AP called &quot;WA4101&quot; which looks a lot like 3Com&#039;s and has TKIP/AES.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Reviews-132-ProdID-3CRWE554G72.php&quot;&gt;Toms Networking&lt;/a&gt; has a review of 3Com&#039;s 11g Gateway which is based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intersil.com/pr/shell/0,1091,1014,00.html&quot;&gt;ISL3893 WiSOC &lt;/a&gt;&amp; Prism GT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Misco&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The package definitely contains the right access point.  But I&#039;m not sure which PCMCIA card.  Ok, just phoned Misco, it is the 3CRWE154G72.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.misco.co.uk/productinformation/45228/WW/3COM_11G_ACCESS_POINT_AND_GET_A_FREE_11G_PC_CARD/index.htm&quot;&gt;link to Misco&#039;s deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CD-R&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I got rid of the &quot;CD software&#039;s been disabled&quot; note that popped up when WinXP started.  I found the problem by looking at the sys logs.  The offending file was Cdr4vsd.SYS.  I removed the file and all reference to it in the registry.  It&#039;s an Adaptec file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kerio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Occasionally an error message &quot;could not start DB server: socket() failed&quot; pops up, Kerio fails to load and the computer refused to connect to the network.  Tried reinstalling Kerio, that didn&#039;t work.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.kerio.com/index.php?_a=knowledgebase&amp;_j=questiondetails&amp;_i=71&quot;&gt;I&#039;ve found &lt;/a&gt;that Kerio uses port 44334 to connect to its server.  So if it still doesn&#039;t work in the future then I&#039;ll look into this.  I&#039;ve also changed the services settings for Kerio - I&#039;ve asked it to retry several times to load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: New Pedals &amp; Clean!</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/04/new_pedals_clea.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday 9th, I did some work to my bike.  Cleaned it.  Cleaned the chain (it&#039;s silver again!).  Changed the pedals - be warned, the threds go the UNEXPECTED way, i.e. you&#039;re actually at risk of unscrewing the pedals when pedalling.  The SPDs seem to work fine (one I&#039;d got the shoe clips screwed on the right way!).  Oh, and the bottom bracket seemed loose so I took it out, cleaned it and put it back.  It&#039;s damn stiff.  Maybe I need a new one?  Oh, and I took off the panier carrier.  Anyway, I&#039;m very happy with my bike now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that damn clicking has gone!  Probably was the pedal but could have been the loose bottom braket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/04/new_kings_site.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, I&#039;ve installed another copy of phpBB2 and Gallery ready for the King&#039;s site.  Both needed a bit of hacking (as per Gallery&#039;s guides) to get the two to play together.  I&#039;ve uploaded all the King&#039;s photos (annoyingly Gallery wouldn&#039;t upload the photos that were already on the website so I zipped them up and uploaded them again).  The search facility works very well.  I think this will be good!  But it would be cool if it was less hierachical and more data-base driven.  So I&#039;ve posted to a couple of PHP newsgroups to ask if such a Gallery exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I should write to Gallery to ask if they&#039;ll make it less hierachical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All looks cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Exciting stuff!  I still haven&#039;t heard back from 3Com&#039;s tech support re: chipset but it looks damn sure that both the PCMCIA card &amp; WAP both use the Prism GT chipset (AES in hardware &amp; 802.11e QoS).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Where&#039;s my 3Com kit!?!  I ordered it on the 10th but it still hasn&#039;t arrived!  I phoned Misco yesterday and they said it should have been delivered yesterday.  But it hasn&#039;t arrived!  So I&#039;ve phoned them again today.  Apparently Amtrack (the courier) put it on the wrong van yesterday.  It was scanned on the correct van this morning at 6am.  So it should arrive today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use extension 3 for customer services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And be prepared to be battered by advertising while you wait in the que.  Misco must take the prize for making automated phone systems EVER MORE anoying.  But I guess they are cheap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;http://www.nature.com/nsu/040405/040405-9.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Alcohol and tobacco are the terrible twins of public health. Both increase the risk of cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Both are promoted aggressively by a powerful industry. And both can be horribly addictive...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;According to a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO), the harm caused by alcohol nearly equals that from smoking1. Add in the social consequences of drinking, including wrecked families and lost days at work, which were excluded from the WHO report, and alcohol should arguably be the greater concern&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: Wireless works!</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/04/wireless_works.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I installed my wireless network this evening.  And it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) There are at least 2 other networks in range on channels 6 an 11.  I originally used channel 11 which worked fine when the laptop was in the study but failed when I took the laptop into the living room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) ClearChannel selected a clear channel (2) on its first attempt but selected a used channel (11) on the 2nd attempt.  So I&#039;ve now told the WAP to use channel 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) WPA-PSK TKIP works using the &quot;predefined key&quot;.  But AES doesn&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) 3Com&#039;s card manager doesn&#039;t play nicely with Windows&#039; WiFi config wizard.  At the time of writing, only Windows&#039; control system understands WPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) NetStumbler doesn&#039;t support 3Com cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) I&#039;m using the most up to date firmware and drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Wireless ROCKS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 21.4.04&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here&#039;s what I would suggest for getting WPA to work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; On the WAP, enable WPA (urg, this could be a nightmare for dyslexics!) and set it to &quot;pre-defined key&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt; Type in anything over 8 characters.  E.g. &quot;Caswell likes WiFi.&quot;  The WAP will turn this text string into the 64-digit long hex WPA security key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; On your laptop, make sure you&#039;ve got the WPA update from Microsoft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Under security, select WPA and TKIP (not AES).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Type in your &quot;pre-defined key&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt; Everything might work at this point.  If not, re-start your laptop (or perhaps just log off and log back on... or maybe you just need to kill the wireless connection and re-start it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: TikiWiki, FilmSoc &amp; PhotoAlbum software</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/04/tikiwiki_filmso.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I e-mailed Iesh (FilmSoc&#039;s President) to offer my services as FilmSoc&#039;s webmanager.  I think it&#039;ll be cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/tikiwiki&quot;&gt;TikiWiki&lt;/a&gt; which could be a cool engine for the FilmSoc site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, whilst researching SQL DBs for the PhD, I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/linpha/&quot;&gt;The Linux Photo Archive&lt;/a&gt;.  This uses MySQL and looks pretty good.  It&#039;s definitely got better search facilities that Gallery 1.4.3rc2.  Perhaps I should look more seriously at it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: Accident</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/04/accident.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday evening I had a bit of an accident on my bike.  I was cycling through Hyde park when I collided with a pedestrian.  It was my fault really - I was going too fast.  But he thought it was his fault and was very appologetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result was that I collided with the railings that run along side the cycle track.  My back is now quite badly bruised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;image src=&quot;/mt/images/bruising.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taken to hospital in an ambulance (they brought my bike).  They checked it out and apparently I&#039;ve just bruised the muscle in my lower back.  Ginnie came and visited me in hospital (which was very nice).  My spine&#039;s absolutely fine.  They gave me lots of painkillers including diazapan!  And we got a very expensive cab home (with bike) - God I hate how much minicabs take liberties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#039;ve taken Thu and Fri off work and done some work from home using our new wireless network!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be completely better in a couple of weeks.  The bike looks fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I did all the hacks that you&#039;re supposed to do.  But the &quot;search&quot; facility for gallery complained.  So I went into page_header.php in forum/includes and commented out the paragraph from line 467 to read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;My backs getting better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed a second wiki on my main site.  I then spent ages trying to figure out how to add my navigation bar to the Wiki.  With no luck.  I think this sort of &quot;skinning&quot; will get easier as MediaWiki matures.  For example, there&#039;s limited support for Smarties now but that&#039;s getting better.  I tried downloading the most recent CVS version but it wouldn&#039;t install - it claimed there was some sort of SQL error.  So I&#039;m just gonna have to wait for MediaWiki v1.2.5&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;After having quite an unsatisfactory day at work which seemed to be spent trying to customise MediaWiki for my own site, I&#039;ve had a very nice evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ginnie cooked a gorgeous dinner and I&#039;ve since been reading various articles on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;WikiPedia&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#039;ve known about WikiPedia for a few months now but I admire it more than ever now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that I should learn more about current affairs - I&#039;ve been  slowly grinding my way through Economist articles.  But now that I&#039;ve spent an evening with WikiPedia I expect I&#039;ll be able to handle the Economist articles that much better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/04/fixed_problem_w.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When uploading movies, Gallery reports that it hits a base_dir problem and then fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried tinkering with the base_dir settings but no joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s the fix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to /gallery/classes/AlbumItem.php and change line 494 to 			fs_copy(&quot;/home/httpd/vhosts/XLK.org.uk/httpdocs/forum/modules/gallery/images/movie.thumb.jpg&quot;, &quot;$dir/$name.thumb.jpg&quot;);&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a transoesophageal echocardiogram today.   They wanted too take a look at the back of my heart because my last echo suggested that some blood may be leaking between the two sides of the heart.  The proceedure was simple enough - they put a line in, sprayed local anathetic into my mouth, attached an ECG machine, gave my oxygen, injected a light sedative and the pushed the tube down my throat. I gagged a few times but it was fine.  The tube was only down my throat for about 10 mins.  And it&#039;s all clear!  I asked for a picture of my heart but they wouldn&#039;t give me one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Granddad was in hospital and was looking very very weak.  He could hardly talk.  He&#039;d stopped eating on Sunday and had refused a glucose drip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to London on Wednesday night for a course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandad died at 3pm on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Saw Nick Collins &amp; Ed Everett on Saturday night.  Almost saw Mark but it didn&#039;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was nice - spent with Ginnie.  Then Ginnie left to go on her course at about 7pm - she&#039;ll be back on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on Sun evening I went to NewsRevue with Dan.  Very edgy but pretty funny.  Nicely thought-provoking.  One guy walked out half way through, supposedly because he was so offended.  But I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or is bottled water just fucking laughable?  I imagine the birth of bottled water something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1950ish.  A group of cynical young students are getting lashed in the pub.  They&#039;ve got onto the topic of marketting.  One guy cracks the joke that &quot;branding is a powerfull thing.  I bet you could brand the most common substance if you tried! People just can&#039;t get enough of labels.&quot;  The rest of his friends crack up at the obserd thought of branding water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one evil onlooker takes the joke seriously and gives it a go.  Witness the birth of the farse that is bottled water.  And with it comes the environmental impact of transporting water not by pipe (as the Romans would have done it) but - wait for it - in little bottles in big lorries.  Hurray for technological progress.  Hurray for the intelligence of modern man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bunch of wankers.  The lot of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Really really sexy fusion of old-school funk with lush electronic production values.  He&#039;s playing on London on Monday 14th but I&#039;m not sure if there are any tickets left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like dirty, funky hip-hop then I strongly recommend RJD2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Strikingly posh, white and rich though.  Almost sickeningly so.  Dudes who have no shame spending Â£100k+ on a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went for dinner at the new Indian place near the flat... really good food.  And cheap.  And nice atmospher.  Good alrounder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of a worry earlier today... my WinXP machine refused to open Control Panel, claiming that &quot;The system cannot find the device, file or folder.  You may not have permission.&quot;  After some searching on the web, some worrying that I had some nasty spyware and concerns that I&#039;d spend next weekend re-formatting my hard disk, I discovered that the problem was Kerio.  It had prevented access to some important DLL.  So beware.  Kerio can to scary stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&#039;ve been reading more... this leads to the question of how best to make notes on all the articles I&#039;m reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, I have been using my own PhD wiki.  But now I&#039;m attempting to add everything new I learn to Wikipedia.  My thought is that Wikipedia is has the potential to be very useful to research scientists because it could act as a continuously updated, highly detailed review article.  Which is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&#039;s also a good place to practice writing and to test out ideas before comitting to print in a &#039;real&#039; science paper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve recently changed my entire chainset.  About a month ago I changed the crankset and BB because my old crankset developed a crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, this weekend, I replaced the chain and cassette.  All very painless.  And now the bike feels beautiful - it used to feel quite gritty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One small problem: the new Shimano LX Octalink BB and crankset make a clicking noise once in a while - this seems to be fixed by tightening the crankset bolt.  But why does the bolt keep loosening?  I dunno yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine (Laura Derain) from King&#039;s is running the New York Marathon in aid of the British Heart Foundation.  It&#039;s a fantastic cause and you should sponsor her...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can sponsor her by going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bhf.org.uk/sponsor/lauraderain&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a quote from her site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.bhf.org.uk/sponsorship/images/sponsorpages/upload/C24C949B-C962-472B-B6BD-80284508E34F.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sophia&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophia was admitted to the Brompton in early January 2003 and left Great Ormond Street in June 2003 after having her heart transplant. She is now 20 months old and has been home for over a year. She is happy and bright and has almost caught up with her twin brother whom she adores. Sophia is now walking, talking and has a wonderful sense of humour. Alexander welcomed her back straight away and he cuddles her, strokes her hair and greets her through his cot bars every morning. The children attend play and music classes, swimming lessons and have gone on several trips abroad. Sophia is now living a normal life because of the unbelievable generosity of a family who suffered a terrible tragedy. The precious gift that they gave to us has transformed not just SophiaÂs life but every one around her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five thousand babies are born with heart defects every year in Britain and for most, like Sophia, there are still no answers as to why this happens. In an attempt to support the excellent work done by the British Heart Foundation and raise awareness for organ donation, I am running the New York Marathon, along with Sophia&#039;s parents, in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be generous..I am aiming to raise over Â£2,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With love,&lt;br /&gt;
Laura x&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first published study to track methane on Mars has concluded that life is &quot;the only plausible source of the gas&quot;.  But not everyone is convinced (but you could have guessed that, right?).&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2004/11/installing_gent.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend I made some good progress with the install of Gentoo on my laptop.  I got WiFi to work, configured KDE, read up on USE flags and some other bits and pieces, installed OpenVPN, rdesktop, prelink, prism54 and wireless-tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Gentoo will be good on the laptop.  It is more responsive than XP and the WiFi link seems to be rock solid (XP&#039;s wifi connection is a bit dodgy).  Also, my brief tinkering with SAMBA on Suse suggests that Samba is much better behaved than windows networking - no more waiting ages for a directory to load up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly - my excuse for not posting for a while: my current hosting provider (www.cian.net) have changed their hosting policies and I can&#039;t afford to live here anymore so I&#039;m in the process of moving the www.hosingeye.com.  I haven&#039;t moved yet because it&#039;s taking so damn long to get Cian to sort it out.  So I&#039;ve been holding back on posting on my blog in case the transfer fails.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;At about October last year I took the plunge into Linux.  I now run Linux on my office computer and my home laptop.  I&#039;m very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&#039;s not great for video editing.  My current hope is that Adobe will port their software over to Linux.  That would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some links:&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, my weblog has been very sparse for the last few months.  That&#039;s because it&#039;s taken my three months to move my website from CIAN over to HostingEye.  HostingEye have been great.  But CIAN were bought up by another company in January 2005 and it&#039;s been a real struggle to get my website transfered over.  But we&#039;re there now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to posting more blog posts soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2005/09/sorry_some_stuf.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Some parts of my website have been broken for a while.  &lt;a href=&quot;/gallery/&quot;&gt;My web gallery&lt;/a&gt; has been broken for some time because my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostingeye.com&quot;&gt;old web host&lt;/a&gt; &quot;upgraded&quot; and, in doing so, broke my gallery.  After several months of asking them to change their settings, I&#039;ve had to move to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.site5.com&quot;&gt;new host&lt;/a&gt;.  Now that I&#039;ve moved, the gallery works but it will take a few days to get all the links sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have to modify my new web gallery so it integrated properly with the rest of my website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Firstly, they&#039;re an excellent electro-rap-funk bank.  Secondly, two of my best friends from school (DCPS) are in the band (Pete and Druze).  I took some photos last night; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xlk.org.uk/gallery/v/Jacks_photos/gigs/crackvillage_medicinebar/&quot;&gt;these photos are now online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: Large off road vehicles and pedestrian saftey</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2005/11/view_image.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I&#039;ve been hearing conflicting reports about the &quot;pedestrian safety&quot; of large off road vehicles.  I&#039;ve finally got round to doing some basic statistics on the data available on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euroncap.com&quot;&gt;euroNCAP website&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/cars.html&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(&#039;http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/cars.html&#039;,&#039;popup&#039;,&#039;width=1270,height=917,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#039;); return false&quot;&gt;Here are my results&lt;/a&gt;.  The error bars are 1 standard deviation from the mean (i.e. each error bar has a total length of 2xsd).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are quite compelling.  The &quot;large off road vehicles&quot; aren&#039;t good news for pedestrians.&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>old blog: I&#039;ve been hacked!</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2006/01/ive_been_hacked.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, Site5 took me offline at 1:30pm today saying that my site had been compromised.  To be honest, I thought it had to do with the Drupal experiments that I and Ed have been doing.  After updating all of my php scripts I found that I really have been hacked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xlk.org.uk/forum was hacked!  Judging by the time-stamp, it looks like it was done at 00:20 on the 2nd Jan 2006.  My old (hacked) version of phpBB2 was 2.0.10.  Today I updated to 2.0.19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/hacked2_small.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things the hackers did:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They inserted a file in /forum called &lt;a href=&quot;/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/phpA.txt&quot;&gt;.phpA&lt;/a&gt; with lots of links to their websites.  Timestamped 00:20 on 2nd Jan 2006.  An excert is given below...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They modified the phpBB2 database.  They changed the site_desc and sitename in the phpbb_gen_config table to &quot;TURKISH HACKER&quot; and &quot;aLpTurkTegin Hacked&quot; respectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They also added a forum called &quot;aLpTurkTegin&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s an excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/phpA.txt&quot;&gt;the .phpA file&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
chk s89239188.onlinehome.us/forum/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=2907 &gt;viewtopic ok
chk www.ukmix.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20907 &gt;viewtopic ok

chk www.pelhammessageboard.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=3476 &gt;viewtopic ok
...and it goes on like this for 803 lines...
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fixed the problem by first searching the phpBB2 database for anything containing words like &quot;Iraq&quot; or &quot;Turk&quot; etc and modifying or deleting those records.  I then checked to see if any other files had been modified on the 2nd Jan by running &quot;find . -atime 2&quot; in my home directory (i.e. search for everything modified 2 days ago).  I also tried searching for files which were modified 1 or 3 days ago.  The only file modified 2 days ago was .phpA so I deleted that and everything returned to normal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also searched within all my files for suspicious words like &quot;Iraq&quot; etc by running &quot;grep &quot;Iraq&quot; -R *&quot; at in my home directory.  This didn&#039;t return anything suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wierdly, I just tried putting .phpA back into /forum but it didn&#039;t do anything.  I tried chmodding to a+x but that didn&#039;t do anything either.  Odd.  I&#039;ve removed it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/hacked2.png&quot;&gt;A screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of the hacked xlk.org.uk/forum site&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/hacked1.png&quot;&gt;A screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of the forum just after I&#039;d updated it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/grep_jan_forum.txt&quot;&gt;An except from the access logs&lt;/a&gt; for xlk.org.uk after filtering for just entries from either the 1st or 2nd of jan looking at the /forum folder.  I&#039;m not expert but I think the activites from IP address 66.235.195.155  on 01/Jan/2006:23:35:52 -0500 look a bit suspicious&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;update: I was emailed today by someone who runs one of the sites listed in phpA.txt.  He points out that he is not a Turkish computer criminal!  Secondly, he points out that the list must instead be a log file of all the websites that are vulnerable to this exploit and so I have deleted the phpA.txt file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: Work starts on our new house!</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2006/07/work_starts_on.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.xlk.org.uk/gallery/d/8872-2/DSC_0100.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Ginnie (my girlfriend) and I got the keys for our new home in Peckham / East Dulwich and we&#039;ve been busily working on it so it&#039;s habitable by the 21st August (when we have to leave our flat in Baron&#039;s Court).  The house needs quite a lot of work.  Every room needs at least a new carpet, wallpaper removed, re-plastering and re-painting.  Most of the rooms need more work.  The study, for example, needs the plasterboard ceiling removed, a couple of sky-lights installed and maybe some solar water heaters installed on the roof.  And, of course, the house has to been sufficiently geeked-up with networking and A/V cable runs, LED lighting, solar-assisted water heating etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most &quot;hard core&quot; project is knocking out two load bearing walls to extend the kitchen.  The end result will be a kitchen that has French doors leading out to the garden.  Over the last few weeks we&#039;ve been digging out the back garden so the French doors will be able to open!  We estimate that we&#039;ve probably moved about 1.5 tonnes of soil so far.  Most of the soil has gone onto the front garden (which used to be an ugly concrete slab).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m going to try to keep a diary of our work here on my blog under the &quot;house&quot; heading.  Lucky you, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ll keep photos of our progress &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xlk.org.uk/gallery/v/events_and_shared/home&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of the projects we&#039;re planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitchen:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend the kitchen (knock down existing downstairs bathroom)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install French doors leading to garden&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut big hole and install new window&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move boiler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install new kitchen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install under-floor heating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-paint &amp; re-tile&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New lighting &amp; lighting wiring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency &amp; re-claiming water:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Possibly use LED lights in the kitchen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install an extra layer of insulation in the loft&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install room thermostats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research cavity-wall insulation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install under-floor insulation for the 1st floor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rain water butts for front and back gardens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grey-water system (re-use water from the shower for the toilet)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for a water meter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install burglar alarm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install fire alarm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geeky:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install CAT5e networking cable &amp; sockets &amp; A/V cables &amp; RF&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skype VoIP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rip off (very low) plasterboard ceiling in study; re-install&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New carpet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Re-paint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New lighting &amp; lighting wiring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fit solar water panel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living room:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sand floor boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-paint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New lighting &amp; lighting wiring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etc... etc.... etc...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: A day of planning &amp; research: lighting, solar, planning</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2006/07/a_day_of_planni.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I did quite a lot of research and planning on lighting.  I learnt about CRI &amp; clever fluorescent lamps.  The current lighting plan is to have 6500 K, dimable, 98 CRI fluorescents in the study for maching my D65 video monitor.  W&#039;e&#039;ll also have funky hanging, dimmed down filament lamps in the study.  In the kitchen we&#039;ll have fluorscenst tubes hidden above the wall cabinets, projecting onto the ceiling.  Why fluorescents?  Because they can give a very nice light if you get the right tubes, they&#039;re dimmable (using the right ballasts) and they&#039;re the most efficient lamps available (yes, more efficient than current white LED tech).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar water heating: I did some diagrams and &lt;a href=&quot;http://navitron.org.uk/forum/index.php?topic=193.msg989#msg989&quot;&gt;posted on Navitron&#039;s forum&lt;/a&gt;.  Need to do more diagrams.  Finding where to put the tank is proving to be tough.  As is figuring out which roof is best: our SE roof or our SW roof?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.xlk.org.uk/ext_images/boiler_tank_layout.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve put some more photos in the gallery (all be it with dodgy names because I didn&#039;t understand how Gallery remote does its thing).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Opps!  It&#039;s been ages since I last posted, sorry.  Loads has happened since I last posted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kitchen is almost finished.  The wall has been knocked down, the french doors installed, the tiles put down and the cabinets installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We finally have a fridge and a sink again!  Thank God for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#039;ve setup most of my editing kit in the spare room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll try to blog more frequently now that my computer is setup and working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>old blog: Lighting</title>
 <link>http://www.XLK.org.uk/mt/logfiles/jacksweblog/archives/2006/10/lighting.html</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#039;ve been doing lots of research on efficient lighting for our kitchen.  It sounds simple: we want efficient and dimmable lighting with a decent colour rendering index.  We&#039;re having two types of lighting: a dimmable fluorescent strip light above the cabinet (high frequency ballast, high CRI tri-phosphor tubes).  That&#039;s fine.  The problem is the down-lights installed in the ceiling.  Tungsten lights are just offensive.  They burn 90% of their energy as heat (and, indeed, they can get so hot that they can ignite insulation installed in the ceiling).  So that leaves us with four options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Dimmable CFLs.  All the major companies have dimmable compact fluorescents.  But, after phoning GE, Philips and Osram, I find that they don&#039;t sell any dimmable CFLs in the UK.  Philips should introduce them in Q1 2007.  Osram sells a &quot;LE VARIO&quot; CFL but it only has two modes of operation: fully on or 60% dimmed.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.megamanuk.com/products/product.php?sid=17&quot;&gt;Megaman sells a dimmable CFL&lt;,/a&gt; with five modes of operation but it doesn&#039;t come in a reflector housing (available for purchase &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebulbshop.com/acatalog/Bayonet_fit_conventional_style.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  So, we considered making our lighting system &quot;CFL-upgradable&quot; but then I hit against another problem: we don&#039;t have enough space in our ceiling for E38 fittings!  They need about 190mm; we only have about 160mm of headroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Cold cathodes come in small packages but none are dimmable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) LEDs.  I bought an LED ages ago but the light output was feeble and it has a crap CRI: skin tones look very sickly.  But, after finding that CFLs wouldn&#039;t work, I did some more research on LED lights.  It turns out that eBay has some real bargains from sellers in Hong Kong.  I&#039;ve ordered a couple of lights and we&#039;ll see if they&#039;re any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) CFLs with non-integrated ballasts and use dimmable ballasts.  Pros: good colour rendition, very energy efficient, very controllable.  Cons: COST!  The ballasts are very expensive (ÃÂ£50 for one that controlls 2 lights) and the fittings look very corporate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
