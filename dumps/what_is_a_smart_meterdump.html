<p>Your existing electricity meter probably looks something like this:</p>

<p>By 2019, the UK government have mandated every electricity meter in homes and businesses will be replaced by a "smart meter" (that's a grand total of 53 million meters). <br/>A smart meter is simply a digital meter with some basic communications functions. <br/>It will be paid for and installed by the utility company. <br/>It will talk to the utility company over a GPRS data connection; and it will also be able to talk to the "home area network" to provide data to in-house energy displays.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/publications/basket.aspx?filetype=4&amp;filepath=11/tackling-climate-change/smart-meters/2393-smart-metering-industrys-draft-tech.pdf&amp;minwidth=true#basket">draft spec</a><br/>for smart meters in the UK<br/>was published by the <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/tackling/smart_meters/smdg/smdg.aspx">Smart Metering Design Group</a><br/>in August 2011. <br/>The specification states that the meter must be able to supply meter readings to the home area network at a rate of one reading every five seconds. <br/>The meter will measure voltage, real power and reactive power (in both directions). <br/>Some utility companies have already started to install smart meters; British Gas plan to have 2 million smart meters installed by the end of 2012 (<a href="http://www.centrica.com/index.asp?pageid=1041&amp;newsid=1970">Centrica, 2010</a>).<br/></p>
<p>If you can't wait for a smart meter to be installed then you could buy and install a "home energy monitor". These are available for around £40; although some utility companies give them away for free. <br/>Home energy monitors are user-installable. <br/>I used a Current Cost home energy monitor for <a href="http://jack-kelly.com/my_msc_project_on_disaggregation_is_on_the_imperial_website">my MSc project on disaggregation</a>. <br/>It recorded a sample of apparent power once every six seconds.</p>
<p>This is a reading produced by my Current Cost home energy monitor:</p>

<p>The value of sample at time<br/><em>t</em><br/>is the sum of the power being consumed by every appliance active at time<br/><em>t</em>​.</p>
